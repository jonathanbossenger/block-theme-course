# Outline 

Current outline of the planned lessons:

- Disabling Theme Settings in theme.json
	- Disable/enable specific settings in the Site editor
	- Understand which settings are enabled when enabling appearanceTools
- Locking Blocks to Prevent User Changes
	- Lock specific blocks in place 
	- "Content only" locking

## Notes:

Removed the section for "Disable the ability to unlock blocks on a per-user basis" [based on previous in-ticket discussion](https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/issues/846#issuecomment-1242789409).  This gets more into plugin territory.

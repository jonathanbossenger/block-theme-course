# Applying Font Families via the Styles Interface

WordPress allows theme authors and users to apply default font families to elements and blocks.  Both methods are available through the Styles interface under the Appearance > Editor screen.

On that screen, locate the Styles button at the top of the screen and click it.  It should open a sidebar panel with several design options, as shown in the following screenshot.

This is the starting point for configuring typography at the global scale, regardless if it is for elements or blocks.

## Applying Font Families to Elements

To modify the base text font or other elements, you should click on the "Typography" button in the Styles sidebar panel.  You will see several options for modifying the typography, such as:

- Text
- Links 
- Headings
- Buttons

For this lesson, let's alter the "Text" option, which is the equivalent of applying styles to the `<body>` element in CSS.  After selecting this option, locate the "Font" setting, as shown in the following screenshot:

You should at least see a choice between "Default" and "Open Sans" (your registered font) available.  Saving this option will make this the default font family for the entire site, and it will only be overruled by a more specific value on other elements and blocks.

## Applying Font Families to Blocks

To apply a font family to a specific block by default, the process is pretty similar.  Return the original Styles panel shown at the beginning of this lesson.  You should see button labeled "Blocks."  Click on this to open a new section, which should list all of the available blocks:

From this point, you can select any block that supports typography options, such as Paragraph, Heading, Site Title, and others, to change the block's default font family.

For this lesson, locate the "Site Title" block, which will open a new sub-panel.  Then, select the "Typography" option.  From that point, the settings should look similar to those in the previous section of this lesson.  Select the "Open Sans" under the "Font" option, as shown in the following screenshot.

From that point, all you need to do is save your progress to apply the changes to the site's front end.

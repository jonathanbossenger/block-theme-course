# The Block Theme For This Course

In the previous module, you reviewed the basics of a block theme by creating a very limited theme.json, a few templates, and a few template parts.

For the rest of this course, you're going to be using those files and developing a working block theme, with a bunch of theme.json settings and styles, and the rest of the the primary templates.

The theme you will be building is based on the Twenty Twenty Three (aka TT3) theme that shipped with WordPress version 6.1. It's a very simple theme, but it's a great starting point for learning how to build a block theme.

You won't be building all the features of TT3, but you will learn how to build the most important parts of it.

## A Note on Theme Design

The design of the theme you will be building is not the focus of this course. You will be focusing on the technical aspects of building a block theme.

Generally you, or a designer you work with, would design the theme using something like Figma or Sketch. That designs would include the following:

1. A style guide, which contains things like the colours and typography used in the theme.
2. A design system, which contains things like the spacing and layout used in the theme, including specific elements like buttons.
3. A set of layouts for each of the templates and (possibly) the template parts.

To learn more about the process of design a theme, check out the following resources:

1. [Designing a WordPress Theme module in the Create a Low Code Block theme course](#)
2. [The open source theme designs](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/07/01/open-sourcing-theme-designs/) released by the WordPress design team, which includes the designs for TT3.

The Twenty Twenty Three designs are available to [view on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1139275543113752375) but we recommend making a copy of the designs and working on your own copy.

> **Note:** Use the **Get a copy** button on a public Figma design to copy if to your own Figma account.

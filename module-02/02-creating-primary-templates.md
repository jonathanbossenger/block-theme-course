# Introduction

As discussed in the last lesson, the primary templates are:
- index
- singular
- archive
- single
- page
- home
- 404
- search

In the recap of templates lesson, you created the index and page templates. Now, you can create the rest of the primary templates in the editor. A good place to start would be the single template, as it would be used for displaying a single post.

## Creating a Primary Template

Creating the single template follows the same process you followed when creating the page template.

> 1. Navigate to the list of templates in the editor
> 2. Click the "Add New" button
> 3. Select the "Single" template from the list

The editor will create the single template, and populate it with a copy of the content from your index template. You can then edit the template to add/remove the content you want to display for a single post. 

For now, you can leave the template as is, save it, and then move on to creating the other primary templates:

- Archive
- Front Page - the home template
- 404
- Search

Once you've created your templates in the editor, use either the Export tool in the editor, or the Export or Overwrite options in Create Block Theme to export the templates as files in your theme.

## Template Structure

# Introduction

This repository contains the course content for the [Extend a Block Theme Course](https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/issues/821) course.

## Notes to the reviewer

Please note when reviewing this course, that there are certain assumptions that have been made about the learner. Typically, the audience for this course falls into two categories:

1. The learner is a classic theme developer who, before the advent of block themes,  has created a number of free themes for WordPress.org, commercial themes that they sells on a theme marketplace, and/or a few custom themes for specific clients. With the advent of the WordPress block editor, and the ability to create themes from the Site Editor, they want to take their experience as a classic theme developer and learn how to build custom themes using blocks

2. The learner has watched a few online tutorials on Block theme fundamentals OR completed the [Create a Block Theme (Low-Code) - Course](https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/issues/631#course-outline) OR read the relevant sections in the handbook on [Block Themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/block-themes/) and understands the fundamentals of block themes, but can see the limitations of a block theme thatâ€™s only created in the Site Editor, and wants to understand how to extend a custom block theme beyond those limitations.

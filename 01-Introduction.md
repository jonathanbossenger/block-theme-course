# Extend a Block Theme

Welcome to the Develop a Block Theme Course!

If you're an experienced theme developer, or new to developing block themes, this course has been designed to help you understand the core differences in developing block themes over the traditional methods.

In this course you will learn how utilize the power of the Site editor to build your layout, design, templates and template parts in the editor. Then, you'll learn how to add things like custom templates, custom fonts, and preloaded images, to make your block theme truly unique.

If you've never developed a block theme before, we recommend that you first complete the [Create a Block Theme (Low-Code)](#link-to-course) course. However, completion of that course is not a requirement to take this one.

## At the end of this course you will be able to:
 - Understand the mechanics of a block theme
 - Register and use custom templates and template parts
 - Add custom elements like fonts, patterns and Global Styles variations
 - Make your block theme ready for translation
 - and so much more!
